# Mocha Moon Cafe

Welcome to **Mocha Moon Cafe**, a cozy late-night spot where artisan brews meet starlit vibes. This is a fictional website built as a part of a responsive web development assignment using only **HTML and CSS** — no frameworks, no JavaScript (except for a small mobile nav toggle).
